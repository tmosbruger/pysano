Tomato is a service that simplifies the task of running jobs on a computer cluster. Tomato does this by monitoring specific directories on servers at the HCI, and transferring data files and scripts from those directories to computer clusters at the CHPC or HCI, executing those jobs, and transferring result files back to you. Tomato also provides a convenient short-hand notation for frequently performed tasks, such as DNA sequence alignment and SAM alignment file manipulation.
